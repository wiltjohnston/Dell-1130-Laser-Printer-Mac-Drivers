# Dell1130MacDrivers
The dell 1130 driver installer for Mac wont work on Ventura, but the drivers seem to work.


Place these files in the respective location under
/Library/Printers

Then connect and add the printer.

at first print you may get an error from gatekeeper about rastertodell
you just need to manually run it so click show in finder.
its located at
/Library/Printers/Dell/1130/rastertodell
right click and choose open. it will appear to fail but try to print again 

or you may be able to edit the gatekeeper somwhow with spctl
